# PermutationCombinationApp
This is a simple console application written in C++ that will help you calculate Permutations(nPr) and Combinations(nCr).

You can compile the program on your system by copying the source code and building the program on your own system, cloninng this repository, or bb downloading the Perm&CombApp.exe file in this repository.

This program is written in an easy to undersand manner and anyone is free to use this program for the required purposes. This can also give a basic idea of how multiple functions can be defined and used in a C++ program to reduce redundant code.

I'm open to constructive criticism and keen to improve, so please feel free to give suggestions on how I can improve my code :)

CURRENT ISSUES(Please suggest solutions if you can):
This application cannot give correct answers for permutations and combinations that involve values above the maximum value of an unsigned long long data type(8 Bytes or numbers greater than 18 446 744 073 709 551 615). Values such as these occur in large factorial calculations.
