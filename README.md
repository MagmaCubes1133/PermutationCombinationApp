# PermutationCombinationApp
This is a simple console application written in C++ that will help you calculate Permutations(nPr) and Combinations(nCr).

You can compile the program on your system by copying the source code and building the program on your own system, cloninng this repository, or bb downloading the Perm&CombApp.exe file in this repository.

This program is written in an easy to undersand manner and anyone is free to use this program for the required purposes. This can also give a basic idea of how multiple functions can be defined and used in a C++ program to reduce redundant code.

I'm open to constructive criticism and keen to improve, so please feel free to give suggestions on how I can improve my code :)
